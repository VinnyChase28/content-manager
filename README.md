## Back End

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

## API's for data

- Movies: TMDB (The movie database REST API)
- Shows: TMDB (The movie database REST API)
- Games: IGDB API (Twitch's game REST API)
    - They do not support CORS headers from the client side, will need to fetch with NEXT.JS built in API to get around this.
- Books TBD

## Front End

[Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

- I will use Styled-Components & Storybook for styling

## Project Goal

This project is a content management system that will allow you to consolidate all of your movies, shows, games and books in one place. You can add to your consumed content list, and create watchlists to enjoy later.
