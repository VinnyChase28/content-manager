## Back End

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

## API's for data

- Movies: TMDB (The movie database REST API)
- Shows: TMDB (The movie database REST API)
- Games: IGDB API (Twitch's game REST API)
  - They do not support CORS headers from the client side, will need to fetch with NEXT.JS built in API to get around this.

## Front End

[Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

- I will use Styled-Components & Storybook for styling

## Project Goal

This project is a content management system that will allow you to consolidate all of your movies, shows, and games in one place. You can add to your consumed content list, and create watchlists/playlists to enjoy later.
